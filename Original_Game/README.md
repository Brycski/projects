#Original Game

**Overview**

Teamed up with fellow UC Berkeley peer Nupur Agarwal to create an original game to develop programming skills, 
teamwork skills while programming, program persistence, and Github familiarity. The game is a race to collect all 5 
"Infinity Stones" as "Thanos" against the NPC "Ironman" from Marvel Studios. The NPC uses A* search algorithm with 
diagonal distance heuristic to find the fastest path to a randomly selected stone. All maps are randomly generated 
using a given seed (maps given the same seed are the same layout).

**Features**

- New World - Start a new game by pressing 'n', input a seed (number(s) with 's' at the end), and use 'WASD' to move. 
  around. Press 'F' to toggle view of enemy's path.
- Quit (mid-game) - By pressing ":q" mid-game, it quits the program and saves the game.
- Quit (menu) - Quits the program.
- Load - Press 'L' to load a saved game and continue where you left off.
- Tile Description - Hover over a tile with your mouse to see a description.

**Running the Project**

Project currently only planned to through IntelliJ IDEA by pressing run on the 'Main' file. **Must install the
following project libraries: xchart-3.8.1.jar, ucb.jar, junit-4.13.2.jar, jh61b-junit.jar, hamcrest-core-1.3.jar,
and algs4.jar.**
